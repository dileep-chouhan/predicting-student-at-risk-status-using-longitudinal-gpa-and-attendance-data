# Predicting Student At-Risk Status using Longitudinal GPA and Attendance Data

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying students at risk of academic failure.  By analyzing longitudinal GPA and attendance data, we aim to create a system capable of flagging at-risk students early, allowing for timely interventions and ultimately improving student retention rates. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation to identify the most effective predictive model.


## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including descriptive statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and potentially feature importance scores.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing GPA trends, attendance patterns, and model performance)  in the `output` directory.  These files will provide a visual representation of the data and the model's performance.  The specific output files and their names may vary depending on the chosen model and analysis steps.
